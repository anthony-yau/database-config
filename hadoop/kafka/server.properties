############################# Server Basics #############################

# The id of the broker. This must be set to a unique integer for each broker.
broker.id=1

# Switch to enable topic deletion or not, default value is false
delete.topic.enable=true

############################# Socket Server Settings #############################

# The address the socket server listens on. It will get the value returned from
# java.net.InetAddress.getCanonicalHostName() if not configured.
#   FORMAT:
#     listeners = listener_name://host_name:port
#   EXAMPLE:
#     listeners = PLAINTEXT://your.host.name:9092
listeners=PLAINTEXT://xxx:9092

# Hostname and port the broker will advertise to producers and consumers. If not set,
# it uses the value for "listeners" if configured.  Otherwise, it will use the value
# returned from java.net.InetAddress.getCanonicalHostName().
#advertised.listeners=PLAINTEXT://your.host.name:9092

# Maps listener names to security protocols, the default is for them to be the same. See the config documentation for more details
#listener.security.protocol.map=PLAINTEXT:PLAINTEXT,SSL:SSL,SASL_PLAINTEXT:SASL_PLAINTEXT,SASL_SSL:SASL_SSL

# The number of threads handling network requests
num.network.threads=32

# The number of threads doing disk I/O
num.io.threads=32

# The send buffer (SO_SNDBUF) used by the socket server
socket.send.buffer.bytes=67108864

# The receive buffer (SO_RCVBUF) used by the socket server
socket.receive.buffer.bytes=67108864

# The maximum size of a request that the socket server will accept (protection against OOM)
socket.request.max.bytes=104857600


############################# Log Basics #############################

# A comma seperated list of directories under which to store log files
log.dirs=/data1/kafka/broker,/data2/kafka/broker

# The default number of log partitions per topic. More partitions allow greater
# parallelism for consumption, but this will also result in more files across
# the brokers.
num.partitions=1

# The number of threads per data directory to be used for log recovery at startup and flushing at shutdown.
# This value is recommended to be increased for installations with data dirs located in RAID array.
num.recovery.threads.per.data.dir=32

############################# Log Flush Policy #############################

# Messages are immediately written to the filesystem but by default we only fsync() to sync
# the OS cache lazily. The following configurations control the flush of data to disk.
# There are a few important trade-offs here:
#    1. Durability: Unflushed data may be lost if you are not using replication.
#    2. Latency: Very large flush intervals may lead to latency spikes when the flush does occur as there will be a lot of data to flush.
#    3. Throughput: The flush is generally the most expensive operation, and a small flush interval may lead to exceessive seeks.
# The settings below allow one to configure the flush policy to flush data after a period of time or
# every N messages (or both). This can be done globally and overridden on a per-topic basis.

# The number of messages to accept before forcing a flush of data to disk
log.flush.interval.messages=100000

# The maximum amount of time a message can sit in a log before we force a flush
log.flush.interval.ms=3000

############################# Log Retention Policy #############################

# The following configurations control the disposal of log segments. The policy can
# be set to delete segments after a period of time, or after a given size has accumulated.
# A segment will be deleted whenever *either* of these criteria are met. Deletion always happens
# from the end of the log.

# The minimum age of a log file to be eligible for deletion due to age
log.retention.hours=72

# A size-based retention policy for logs. Segments are pruned from the log as long as the remaining
# segments don't drop below log.retention.bytes. Functions independently of log.retention.hours.
log.retention.bytes=21474836480

# The maximum size of a log segment file. When this size is reached a new log segment will be created.
log.segment.bytes=1073741824

# The interval at which log segments are checked to see if they can be deleted according
# to the retention policies
log.retention.check.interval.ms=300000

############################# Zookeeper #############################

# Zookeeper connection string (see zookeeper docs for details).
# This is a comma separated host:port pairs, each corresponding to a zk
# server. e.g. "127.0.0.1:3000,127.0.0.1:3001,127.0.0.1:3002".
# You can also append an optional chroot string to the urls to specify the
# root directory for all kafka znodes.
zookeeper.connect=xxx:2181/xxx

# Timeout in ms for connecting to zookeeper
zookeeper.connection.timeout.ms=6000

# Zookeeper session timeout
zookeeper.session.timeout.ms=6000

# Enable auto creation of topic on the server
auto.create.topics.enable=true

# The ratio of leader imbalance allowed per broker.
# The controller would trigger a leader balance if it goes above this value per broker
leader.imbalance.per.broker.percentage=10

# The frequency with which the partition rebalance check is triggered by the controller
leader.imbalance.check.interval.seconds=300

# default replication factors for automatically created topics

# Define whether the timestamp in the message is message create time or log append time.
# The value should be either `CreateTime` or `LogAppendTime`
log.message.timestamp.type=LogAppendTime
#log.message.timestamp.type=CreateTime

# The maximum size of message that the server can receive
message.max.bytes=5242880

# The number of bytes of messages to attempt to fetch for each partition. This is not an absolute maximum,
# if the first message in the first non-empty partition of the fetch is larger than this value,
# the message will still be returned to ensure that progress can be made.
# The maximum message size accepted by the broker is defined via message.max.bytes (broker config) or max.message.bytes (topic config).
replica.fetch.max.bytes=5242880

# Number of fetcher threads used to replicate messages from a source broker.
# Increasing this value can increase the degree of I/O parallelism in the follower broker
num.replica.fetchers=9

# If a follower hasn't sent any fetch requests or hasn't consumed up to the leaders log end offset for at least this time,
# the leader will remove the follower from isr
replica.lag.time.max.ms=10000

# max wait time for each fetcher request issued by follower replicas.
# This value should always be less than the replica.lag.time.max.ms at all times to prevent frequent shrinking of ISR for low throughput topics
replica.fetch.wait.max.ms=5000
